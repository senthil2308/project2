<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:30px;">Student surveys are valuable sources of feedback for teachers and self-reflection for students. Surveys at the beginning, middle, or end of the school year can help you plan effective classes, reach struggling students, and improve your teaching methods.

Of course, not all student survey questions provide useful responses. Here’s a list of student survey questions that’ll help you gather actionable insights from your students:</p>

<h1 style="color:orange;font-family:times new roman;font-size:50px;">Rank this year’s lessons from easiest to hardest.</h1>
<p style="font-family:arial;font-size:30px;">Find out what type of subject material your class struggles with by asking students to rank the most important lessons, from easiest to hardest. The answers will help you understand the material that’s relatively more challenging, allowing you to effectively modify your approach in the future. For example, you can hold a review session following that lesson. Or dedicate more time to improving its curriculum.

You can ask this question using a drag and drop ranking question type. By using lessons as your answer choices, you’ll be able to quickly remind students what you covered in class. These interactive questions are also fun and can prevent straight-lining (when a bored respondent completes a survey quickly by choosing the same answer for every question). Just be careful not to add too many answer options! 10 or more answer options may be too taxing for your respondents.</p>
